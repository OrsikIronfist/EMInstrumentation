## News

*v1.0.0*

I am very excited to say that there is finally a usable release of EMI. This project has taken a lot of twists and turns but I feel like I needed to do the homework before committing to an underlying platform to host the project on. The platform in its current state is admittedly limited in its overall functionality but it does function so I am realizing a production instance available for anyone interested in beta testing the platform.

**Changes**
- Home page has been updated.
- Spring cleaning of code and irrelevant documentation
- EveSSO integration
- ESI integration
- zKillBoard API Integration
- Revamp of internal database architectures
- Character security check functionality
- Local system stargate safety monitoring
- Local system safety monitoring
