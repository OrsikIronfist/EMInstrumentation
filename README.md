*v1.1.131*

Okay I am happy to say we have another quick patch update that released today that includes some comfort fixes like UI updates and a now sortable security checks table so you can easily sort the data by clicking on the header of the column. We also did some behind the scenes stuff with general code optimiaziation and cleanup, fixed a few bugs, and also added a feedback from to the portal so you can quickly send me your thoughts for where I should be going with this platform and its features.

**Changes**
Sortable Security Check area
Google Analytics Improvements
General bug fixes and code optimization
Portal UI improvements
Feedback functionality

*v1.0.0*

I am very excited to say that there is finally a usable release of EMI. This project has taken a lot of twists and turns but I feel like I needed to do the homework before committing to an underlying platform to host the project on. The platform in its current state is admittedly limited in its overall functionality but it does function so I am realizing a production instance available for anyone interested in beta testing the platform.

**Changes**
- Home page has been updated.
- Spring cleaning of code and irrelevant documentation
- EveSSO integration
- ESI integration
- zKillBoard API Integration
- Revamp of internal database architectures
- Character security check functionality
- Local system stargate safety monitoring
- Local system safety monitoring
